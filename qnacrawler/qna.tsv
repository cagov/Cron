Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test?	Yes, if you:\n\n*   Have COVID-19 symptoms,\n*   Were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or\n*   The test is medically necessary for your situation. \n\nIf you have COVID-19 symptoms or think you’ve been exposed, under federal law, you can get a test anywhere and your health plan must pay for it.\n\nIf you are an [essential worker](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf), your health plan must cover your COVID-19 test. But you must contact your health plan before getting tested. \n\nIf none of these things above are true but you’d still like a test, contact your health plan or health care provider.\n\nAs a first step, you can check your symptoms using the [Symptom Screener](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html) or by contacting your doctor.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How long will I have to wait to get a coronavirus test?	Your wait time depends on why you are seeking a test. \n\n**If you have COVID-19 symptoms or think you were exposed,** under federal law, you can go immediately to any testing site. Find a testing site on our [Testing page](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top), or call your health plan for an available testing location.\n\n**If you are an [essential worker](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf),** your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 48 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your home or workplace. If your health plan can’t find you such an appointment, then you can go to any available testing site. Your health plan will pay for the test. \n\n**If neither of these cases above are true,** your provider may still decide that a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you. In that case, your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 96 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your home or workplace. If your health plan can’t find you such an appointment, then you can go to any available testing site.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
I get my health care coverage through my employer, who has a “self-insured” plan. Do the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) regulations apply to me?	Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal government, not the state. If you have COVID-19 symptoms or were exposed to someone with symptoms, under federal law, your self-insured plan must cover your test. In all other instances, you should talk to your plan to find out whether they will cover COVID-19 testing.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How does my health plan know if I’m an essential worker?	Your health plan can ask you questions about why you want a COVID-19 test and about the nature of your work. This helps them determine whether a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you.\n\nBut they can’t ask you to provide further documentation or evidence of your work status.

Cohorts for children and youth in supervised settings – updated September 4	A **cohort** is a stable group of no more than 14 children or youth and no more than two supervising adults in a supervised environment. The group stays together for all activities, including meals and recreation. And this group avoids contact with anyone not in their group.\n\nKids and adults in supervised care environments must be in groups as small as possible. Kids and supervising adults in one group must not physically interact with:\n\n*   kids and supervising adults in other groups\n*   other facility staff\n*   parents of kids in other groups\n\nPracticing a cohort structure:\n\n*   decreases opportunities for exposure to or transmission of the virus\n*   facilitates more efficient contact tracing in the event of a positive case\n*   allows for targeted testing, quarantine, and isolation of a single group instead of an entire population of kids and supervising adults\n\nThe [guidance related to cohorts](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx) of children and youth sets minimum guidelines for providing specialized, targeted support services, necessary in-person child supervision and limited instruction, and facilitation of distance learning in small group environments in ways that maintain the focus on health and safety to minimize transmission.

Should I wear a mask or face covering to protect against COVID-19?	Yes. Californians must wear face coverings when in public spaces, especially indoors and other areas where physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19. \n\nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released [guidance for the use of face coverings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf). \n\nThe guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be: \n\n*   Maintain six feet of physical distance from others \n*   Wash hands frequently\n*   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands\n*   Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/
What is a face covering?	A face covering, also known as a cloth mask, is [material that covers the nose and mouth](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/
How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?	There is scientific evidence to suggest that use of masks or face coverings reduces disease transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but complements them.\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/
How should I care for a cloth mask or face covering?	It’s a good idea to [wash your face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard face coverings that:\n\n*   No longer cover the nose and mouth\n*   Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps\n*   Cannot stay on the face\n*   Have holes or tears in the fabric\n\nSee advice from the CDC on [how to select, wear, and clean your mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/
Are face shields acceptable as face coverings to prevent spread of COVID-19?	Face shields are not recommended as a substitute for masks or face coverings. They primarily provide eye protection for the person wearing it. It is unknown what level of protection a face shield provides to people nearby.\n\n[CDC has detailed recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html) for situations where face shields are the only option.\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/
Is there any proof that masks are effective in preventing coronavirus infection?	Yes. The CDC has collected evidence on the [effectiveness of masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html). \n\nMasks create a barrier that helps prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the wearer coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Using a mask is important in settings where people are close to each other or where it’s difficult to keep physical distance from others.\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/
Is blood plasma authorized as a COVID-19 treatment?	[The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-convalescent-plasma-potential-promising-covid-19-treatment) for convalescent plasma to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in making  COVID-19 illness shorter and less severe in some patients. The FDA also determined that the known and potential benefits of this plasma, when used to treat COVID-19, outweigh its known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments.\n\nMore info: [Survivors of COVID-19: Donate your plasma](https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/

Why can some activities and businesses open while others have to stay closed?	Activities and businesses that have a lower risk of spreading COVID-19 are allowed to open sooner. Higher-risk activities or businesses aren’t allowed until later tiers. An activity or business’s tier depends on whether it can:\n\n*   Accommodate mask wearing at all times (for example, eating and drinking requires removing masks)\n*   Allow physical distance between individuals from different households\n*   Limit the number of people per square foot\n*   Limit time that an individual is at the business or activity\n*   Limit time of exposure\n*   Limit mixing of people from different households\n*   Limit amount of physical interactions of visitors/patrons\n*   Increase airflow (such as operating outdoors or opening windows and doors) \n*   Limit activities that are known to increase virus spread (like singing, shouting and heavy breathing)\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
With this blueprint, what businesses are allowed to open immediately statewide that were previously closed?	As of August 31, 2020, counties in the Widespread (purple) tier may open some businesses and activities with modifications, including all retail, shopping centers at maximum 25% capacity, and hair salons and barbershops indoors.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
What happened to the County Monitoring List?	The Blueprint for a Safer Economy replaces the County Data Monitoring List for determining what business can and cannot open.\n\nSo why change? We learned a lot over the first several months of the pandemic about COVID-19 and how it spreads. For example, we know how much safer outdoor activities are than indoor ones and that it’s critical everyone wears a mask to limit the spread of the disease. This blueprint incorporates what we’ve learned.\n\nThe Blueprint for a Safer Economy is the next evolution of our response. We’ve revised the criteria and the time between changing tiers. We’ve made it easy for counties to see how changes affect the disease’s trajectory and for businesses and customers to plan ahead. And we’ve given Californians one place to look up whether a business or activity is allowed near them.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
What happens if my county’s case rate and positivity measures fall into two different tiers?	If a county’s case rate and positivity rate fall into different tiers, the county remains in the stricter tier.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
Can my school open under this blueprint?	Schools in the Widespread (purple) tier aren’t permitted to reopen for in-person instruction, unless they receive a waiver from their local health department for TK-6 grades.\n\nSchools can reopen for in-person instruction once their county has been in the Substantial (red) tier for at least two weeks. Schools must follow [these guidelines](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-schools--en.pdf) when they reopen or if they have to close again.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
What can I do to help my county reach a lower tier?	*   Wear a mask in public.\n*   Wash your hands regularly.\n*   Keep at least six feet of physical distance when in public.\n*   Limit mixing with people you don’t live with.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/
What is the relationship between the stay home order and these questions and answers?	The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?	The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.\n\nAs of May 8, the stay home order was modified. In addition to essential activity, retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Is it safe to shop at open businesses?	The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these [state guidelines](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can the stay home order be changed?	Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
How does the stay home order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?	This is a statewide order. Counties can have more restrictive criteria and different closures. See [your county’s status](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?	Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top)). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Are gatherings permitted?	Gatherings are defined as meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors in counties in Substantial (red), Moderate (orange), and Minimal (yellow) tiers, subject to [certain restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship) in those counties. State public health directives also permit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health has released [guidance for gatherings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-for-the-Prevention-of-COVID-19-Transmission-for-Gatherings.aspx).\n\nCrowds and limited physical distancing increase the risk for COVID-19. If you attended a gathering, remember that confidential, free testing is available. [Find a testing location near you](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__covid19.ca.gov_testing-2Dand-2Dtreatment_-23top&d=DwMGaQ&c=Lr0a7ed3egkbwePCNW4ROg&r=yRsi0eKVK6Khc58oFC32XROAJ-JqVGBGabDv9P6148k&m=Iul4bdNDGFuRu3rXHrxPHNWT2PT2bXFITW3YP1tzG94&s=4qpOZ7lX1S5M_STTblq_XAQNu05ccIFwIyu4bvl9U3c&e=). If you test negative it does not mean that you may not develop COVID-19 later on. Therefore, it is advisable that you self-isolate for 14 days if possible.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I get a haircut?	Yes. Hair salons and barbershops are now open throughout the state with modifications for safety.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn’t complying?	They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the [Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?	There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.  \n\nAdditionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.\n\nIf collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.  The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.  Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.  \n\nWhenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.\n\nIf you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I engage in political protest gatherings?	Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _outdoor_ protests as long as you maintain a physical distance of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. When you can’t maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from people not in your household, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nIn counties in the [Widespread (purple) tier](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/), indoor protests are not currently permitted. In other counties, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _indoor_ protests as long as (1) attendance is limited as required by the [relevant restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) on places of worship, (2) physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
How do I vote?	**[Elections are an essential activity](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/CDPH-to-SOS-Letter-from-Acting-HO-Aug-18-1.pdf).** The Governor has issued [executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/).

Can I go to church?	Yes. Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with [modifications for safety (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). In counties in the [Widespread (purple)](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) tier, indoor services in places of worship must be discontinued but outdoor and online services are permitted.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I practice my religious faith?	Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?	Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at [guidance for places of worship (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship may only open indoor operations when permitted by [relevant local restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) and must comply with all applicable attendance limitations and guidance requirements.\n\nLocal Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on _outdoor_ attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document.\n\nThis limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/

What do I need to know about COVID-19 and wildfire smoke?	Air pollutants from wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, weaken your immune system, and increase your risk of respiratory infections like COVID-19. Also, wildfire smoke exposure can worsen COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes.\n\nKeep in mind that some respiratory symptoms from wildfire smoke exposure and COVID-19 may be similar. These include cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing.\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms that are unrelated to smoke exposure include fever or chills, muscle or body aches, and diarrhea. If you think you may have COVID-19, contact your doctor.\n\nThe CDC has more detailed information about [Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/smoke-faq.html).\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/
What are the similarities and differences between Influenza (flu) and COVID-19?	Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they’re caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by a [new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics) and flu is caused by [influenza viruses](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/index.htm). \n\nThe symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar. It is hard to tell the difference between them without testing.\n\nCases of COVID-19 and flu can have anything from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms. Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include:\n\n*   Fever or chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Fatigue (tiredness)\n*   Sore throat\n*   Runny or stuffy nose\n*   Muscle pain or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)\n\nThe major difference between them is COVID-19 may include change in or loss of taste or smell.\n\nThe CDC has more information about [similarities and differences between the flu and COVID-19.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm)\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/
Can air conditioning spread COVID-19 from one room to another?	There is no evidence that COVID-19 spreads indoors through air conditioning. There are a wide variety of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Well-designed HVAC systems can actually help reduce risk. Since the system filters air as it circulates, it adds cleaner air to the space. Introduction of fresh outdoor air dilutes the concentration of infectious particles. Air conditioning is also necessary in some areas to protect from excessive heat. For more information, see [ASHRAE guidelines for homeowners and HVAC professionals](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources). \n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/

How long does it take for coronavirus test results to come back?	Turnaround time for coronavirus test results is usually less than two days. Approximately two-thirds are returned within a day and more than 85% are available within two days.\n\nThis turnaround time includes shipping time. So for labs that process home testing kits, turnaround time may depend on when an individual mails back their kit.\n\nIf you haven’t received your test results and it’s been several days, contact your healthcare provider, testing service, or local health department.  \n  \nRead more at [California’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force](https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/).\n\nMore info: [Get tested](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/

Sleep and stay in a separate room from them, and use a separate bathroom, if possible. Multiple infected people in the same household can use the same room for isolation.\n\nMembers of your household should get tested right away. They should [quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) for at least 14 days. Symptoms can develop even after testing negative within 14 days after exposure. Multiple people in the same household should not quarantine in the same room, since some may be infected.\n\nMore info: [Get tested](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
How do I get a drive-through test with Verily?	There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the [online screener](https://lhi.care/covidtesting). If you are eligible, you will get details on how and where to get tested.
