Is it safe to shop at open businesses?	The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these [state guidelines](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/

Counties may move further into the Resilience Roadmap if they meet certain criteria.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?	Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top)). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Are gatherings permitted?	State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community gatherings. Gatherings are defined as meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. State public health directives now do not prohibit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. All other gatherings are prohibited until further notice, except as otherwise specifically permitted in state public health directives (including in applicable industry guidance).\n\nCrowds and limited physical distancing increase the risk for COVID-19. If you attended a protest, remember that confidential, free testing is available. [Find a testing location near you](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__covid19.ca.gov_testing-2Dand-2Dtreatment_-23top&d=DwMGaQ&c=Lr0a7ed3egkbwePCNW4ROg&r=yRsi0eKVK6Khc58oFC32XROAJ-JqVGBGabDv9P6148k&m=Iul4bdNDGFuRu3rXHrxPHNWT2PT2bXFITW3YP1tzG94&s=4qpOZ7lX1S5M_STTblq_XAQNu05ccIFwIyu4bvl9U3c&e=). If you test negative it does not mean that you may not develop COVID-19 later on. Therefore, it is advisable that you self-isolate for 14 days if possible.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- wedding, protest, funeral, banquet, event, outdoor, conference, symposium, rally, rallies, assembly, assemblies, convention, congregation, congregate, congregation, crowd, group, forum, worship -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I get a haircut?	It depends. Hair salons and barbershops are open in counties not on the [County Monitoring List](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties/). However, all indoor operations for these businesses are closed in counties that are on this list. Outdoor hair services may be available.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn’t complying?	They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the [Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?	There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.  \n\nAdditionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.\n\nIf collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.  The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.  Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.  \n\nWhenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.\n\nIf you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I engage in political protest gatherings?	Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _outdoor_ protests as long as you maintain a physical distance of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. When you can’t maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from people not in your household, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nIn counties that have been on the [County Monitoring List](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties/) for three consecutive days, indoor protests are not currently permitted. State public health directives do not prohibit in-person _indoor_ protests as long as (1) attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, (2) physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
How do I vote?	Elections are an essential activity. The Governor has issued [executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/). Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Most counties will provide [three days of early voting](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/) in-person starting the Saturday before the election.Open ballot drop-box locations will be available between October 6 and November 3, 2020. Existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect except where suspended by Executive Order. Find [guidance for the safe administration of elections](https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ccrov/pdf/2020/july/20154jl.pdf) during COVID-19.\n\n Visit [online voter registration](https://registertovote.ca.gov/) to register to vote or check your voter registration status. \n\nPractice physical distancing and follow other applicable public health directives while engaged in election-related activities. These include collection and drop-off of ballots, and collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I go to church?	Yes. Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with [modifications for safety (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). In counties on the [County Monitoring List](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap-counties/), indoor services in places of worship must be discontinued but outdoor and online services are permitted.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I practice my religious faith?	Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?	Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at [guidance for places of worship (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship must therefore limit _indoor_ attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and singing and chanting activities must be discontinued in indoor services. In counties on the County Monitoring List for three consecutive days, places of worship must discontinue indoor services.\n\nLocal Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on _outdoor_ attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document.\n\nThis limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?	At this time, no. Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at all times while visiting facilities. Places of worship must discontinue activities and services for children (for example, shared play areas) where physical distancing of at least 6 feet cannot be maintained.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
When will these conditions change for places of worship?	The California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will regularly review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block?	It’s okay to go outside to go for a walk, to exercise, and participate in healthy activities as long as you **maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet and gather only with members of your household.** You can also participate in activities at [outdoor recreational facilities](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf) that are allowed to open. [Parks may be closed](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/) to help slow the spread of the virus. Check with local officials about park closures in your area.

Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?	State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers [may continue to be closed](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30350) to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check [parks in your area before you travel](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/). Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.\n\nYou can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails and parking lots.\n\nFor information on National Parks, please the [National Park Service website](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- park, visitor center, travel, museum, RV parks, recreation, outdoor recreation, sports, RV, tent camping, tent camp, fish, beach, lake, river, event, outdoor event, event planning, hike, walk, bike, exercise, nature, bird watching, public →</p>-->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I travel?	You can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks. Do not travel with someone who is sick.\n\nYou should check with the local health department where you are starting from, along your route, and at your planned destination for information. Know that local rules are constantly changing and may change even after you start your trip.

New behind-the-wheel driving tests will not be available until all cancelled appointments are completed. \n    *   [For the health and safety of drivers and DMV staff](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-resumes-behind-the-wheel-drive-tests-with-new-protocols-on-friday/), you must wear a face covering and will have your temperature checked before the test.\n\nDMV services that do not require an in-person office visit can be accessed through the [DMV Virtual Field Office](https://virtual.dmv.ca.gov/), including driver’s license renewals, vehicle registrations, title changes, and more.\n\nDMV has extended deadlines for:\n\n*   Drivers 70 years of age and older with licenses expiring between March 1 through December 31, 2020 are valid for one year from the original expiration date.\n*   Drivers 69 years of age and younger with licenses expiring between March 1 through July 31, 2020 can request a free temporary [extension online](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv-virtual-office/temporary-driver-license-extension/), though one is not needed to drive.\n*   Expiring commercial licenses, endorsements, and certificates are valid through June 30, 2020.\n*   In-person renewals for vehicle registrations that expire between the dates of March 16, 2020, and May 31, 2020.\n*   In-person renewals for those with safe driving records whose last DMV visit was 15 years ago.\n*   Driver license permits expiring between June through August 2020 are extended six months or to a date 24 months from the date of application, whichever is earlier.\n*   Commercial learner’s permits expiring between March and June 2020 are now valid through June 30, 2020.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I get my car smog checked?	It depends. Some smog check locations may be closed. The [Bureau of Automotive Repair](https://www.bar.ca.gov/COVID-19_Impacts_on_BAR_Programs_and_Services.aspx) advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, you can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Should I wear a face covering or mask to protect against COVID-19?	Yes. Californians must wear face coverings when in public spaces, especially indoors and other areas where physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19. \n\nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released a [Guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf) for the use of face covering.\n\nThe guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be: \n\n*   Maintain six feet of physical distance from others \n*   Wash hands frequently\n*   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands\n*   Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?	There is scientific evidence to suggest that use of face coverings by the public during a pandemic could help reduce disease transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes, including someone who has COVID-19 but feels well. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but they may be helpful when combined with these primary interventions.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
What is a face covering?	A face covering is [material that covers the nose and mouth](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How should I care for a face covering?	It’s a good idea to [wash your face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard coverings that:\n\n*   No longer cover the nose and mouth\n*   Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps\n*   Cannot stay on the face\n*   Have holes or tears in the fabric\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
What if I don’t have health insurance and I need screening, testing, or treatment for COVID-19?	The cost of medically necessary screening, testing, and treatment for the uninsured is paid for by the [government](https://www.hrsa.gov/CovidUninsuredClaim). You can check your symptoms using the [Symptom Screener](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html) or by contacting your doctor through [telehealth](https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/). You can also get free medically necessary [testing](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/) through [Verily’s Project Baseline](https://www.projectbaseline.com/study/covid-19/eligibility/) or [OptumServe](https://lhi.care/covidtesting).\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
Does my health plan have to cover my COVID-19 test?	Yes, if you’re experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, you think you were exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or the test is otherwise medically necessary for your situation. \n\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you think you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, under federal law, you can obtain a COVID-19 test anywhere and your health plan must pay for the test. \n\nIf you don’t have symptoms and don’t think you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, but you are an [essential worker](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf) as defined for COVID-19 testing coverage, your health plan must cover your COVID-19 test. However, you must contact your health plan before getting testing. \n\nIf you don’t have symptoms, don’t think you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19, and aren’t an [essential worker](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf) as defined for COVID-19 testing coverage, and you think you need a test, please contact your health plan or health care provider for further guidance.\n\nAs a first step, you can check your symptoms using the [Symptom Screener](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html) or by contacting your doctor through [telehealth](https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/).\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How long will I have to wait to get a test?	Your wait time depends on why you are seeking a test. \n\n**If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or think you were exposed,** under federal law, you can go immediately to any available testing site. Find a testing site on our [Testing page,](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/#top) or call your health plan so they can direct you to an available testing location. \n\n**If you don’t have symptoms or suspected exposure, and you are an** [**essential worker**](https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/DMHC-FAQForHealthCoverageOfCOVID-19Testing.pdf)**,** your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 48 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your residence or workplace. If the health plan can’t find you an available appointment within that time and distance, then you can go to any available testing site and your health plan will pay for the test. \n\n**If you don’t have symptoms or suspected exposure, and you are not an essential worker,** if your provider determines a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you, your health plan must offer you a test appointment within 96 hours. The testing site must be within 15 miles or 30 minutes of your residence or workplace. If the health plan can’t find you an available appointment within that time and distance, you can go to any available testing site.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
I get my health care coverage through my employer, who has a “self-insured” plan. Do the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC) regulations apply to me?	Self-insured plans are regulated by the federal government, rather than the state. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you were exposed to someone who you know or suspect has COVID-19, under federal law, your employer’s self-insured plan must cover your test. In all other instances, you should talk to your employer’s self-insured plan to find out whether they will cover COVID-19 testing.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How does my health plan know if I’m an essential worker?	Your health plan can ask you questions about why you want a COVID-19 test and about the nature of your work. They can ask these questions to help determine whether a COVID-19 test is medically necessary for you. \n\nHowever, your health plan can’t ask you to provide further documentation or evidence of your work status. For example, your health plan can’t ask you to provide written proof of where you work or the conditions of your workplace.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
I have a concern or complaint about getting care for COVID-19 under my health insurance. What can I do?	If you are having trouble accessing care, or were inappropriately charged for medically necessary screening, testing, or treatment for COVID-19, follow up directly with your health plan by calling the member phone number listed on your health plan card. If your health plan doesn’t resolve the issue, contact the [California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC)](http://www.dmhc.ca.gov/?referral=healthhelp.ca.gov) Help Center for assistance at 1-888-466-2219.\n\nMore info: [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/

For loans made before June 5, the two-year minimum maturity remains in effect unless both the borrower and the lender agree to extend it to five years. The loan is forgivable if 60% of the loan amount is used for payroll, and no employees are laid off, or if laid-off employees are rehired before December 31, 2020. In addition to payroll and benefits costs, allowable expenses include mortgage interest, rent, and utilities.

How do I get a drive-through test by Verily’s Project Baseline?	There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If you are eligible, you will get details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll get an email or phone call with your COVID-19 test results.\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
Why am I asked to create an account for Verily?	Verily needs a way to authenticate and protect user information. They turned to Google for this service, because Google accounts have best-in-class authentication. Simply link to an existing Google account or create a new one (which you can do with any email address). Then Verily can contact you securely during the screening and testing process. All data r collected by Verily is kept private and is not linked to a user’s Google account.\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
Do I need emergency treatment?	If you develop any of these symptoms of COVID-19, get medical attention immediately:\n\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   Persistent pain or pressure in the chest\n*   New confusion \n*   Inability to awake or stay awake\n*   Bluish lips or face\n\nThere are other, less-common symptoms. Please call your medical provider if you have any symptoms that are severe or concern you.\n\nIf you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you call 911, tell the operator you have coronavirus symptoms. This is so ambulance workers can be ready to treat you safely.\n\nNot sure if this applies to you? Check your symptoms with the [Symptom Screener](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fsymptoms-testing%2Findex.html) or contact your doctor through [telehealth](https://covid19.ca.gov/telehealth/).\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/

Should employees be required to provide proof of a negative coronavirus test before returning to work after they had COVID-19?	No. Proof of a negative test should not be required prior to returning to the workplace after documented COVID infection, since PCR tests can remain positive long after an individual is no longer infectious. CDPH [COVID-19 Testing Guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Updated-COVID-19-Testing-Guidance.aspx) recommends symptom- or protocol-based criteria be used to determine when an employee is safe to return to the workplace.\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
Can two people that both tested positive hang out/stay together?	No. You should take preventive measures to protect yourself and others.

If I test positive for COVID-19 in a viral test, what should I do to protect others in my household?	You should [self-isolate](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/isolation.html) from others in your household who have not tested positive. Sleep and stay in a separate room from them, and use a separate bathroom, if possible. Multiple infected people in the same household can use the same room for isolation.\n\nMembers of your household should get tested right away. They should [quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) for at least 14 days. Symptoms can develop even after testing negative within 14 days after exposure. Multiple people in the same household should not quarantine in the same room, since some may be infected.\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
