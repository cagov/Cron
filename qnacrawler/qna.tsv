Is it safe to shop at open businesses?	The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these [state guidelines](https://covid19.ca.gov/roadmap/).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can the Order be changed?	Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue new orders as the public health situation changes.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/

If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?	Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth below). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and **do not gather with any number of people who are not members of your household.**\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Are mass gatherings permitted?	State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community mass gatherings. Gatherings are defined as—meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are permitted so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. All other mass gatherings are prohibited until further notice.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I get a haircut?	It depends. If your county has been approved to move further in the Resilience Roadmap, then hair salons and barber shops may reopen in your area. See the list of [counties with a variance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/County_Variance_Attestation_Form.aspx).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I visit my family and friends?	It is best to stay connected with your loved ones through phone and video calls, as visiting family and friends outside your household still presents a risk of spreading coronavirus. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people that are at higher risk of getting very sick, including older people, and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions. \n\nIf you do visit family or friends that don’t live in your home in person, take steps to keep everyone safe, like:\n\n*   Keep at least 6 feet between yourself and others, even when you wear a face covering\n*   Visit outdoors instead of indoors when possible\n*   Wear a face covering or cloth mask\n*   Wash your hands often\n*   Clean and disinfect commonly- touched surfaces\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard?	There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.  \n\nAdditionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you **do not gather with people who are not members of your household**.  When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.\n\nIf collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.  The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car protests to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.  Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.  \n\nWhenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.\n\nIf you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I engage in political protest gatherings?	Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person protests as long as (1)  attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2) physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and cloth face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of six feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed at least once every 21 days, beginning May 25, 2020. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
How do I vote?	Elections are an essential activity, and the [Governor has issued executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/). Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Additionally, many in-person voting opportunities will be available: counties are required to provide [three days of early voting](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/) starting the Saturday before the election, and open ballot drop-box locations between October 6 and November 3, 2020. The Secretary of State and the California Department of Public Health are working on additional guidance to ensure that all Californians are able to participate in elections safely. Except where suspended by Executive Order, existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect.\n\nOf course, whenever you engage in any permissible activity—including the collection and drop-off of ballots, or other election-related activities (such as the collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot)—adhere to physical distancing and other applicable public health directives.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I go to church?	Yes. As of May 25, places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with [modifications for safety (PDF)](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I practice my religious faith?	Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
What conditions must be met to resume religious services at places of worship?	Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at [guidance for places of worship (PDF)](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf). Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, congregants engaging in singing, particularly in the choir, and group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship must therefore limit attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. This limitation will be in effect for the first 21 days of a county public health department’s approval of religious services and cultural ceremonies activities at places of worship within their jurisdictions.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?	At this time, no. Children should remain in the care of those in their household unit and not interact with children of other parties at all times while visiting facilities. Places of worship must discontinue activities and services for children (for example, shared play areas) where physical distancing of at least six feet cannot be maintained.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
When will these conditions change for places of worship?	Every 21 days, the California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. This is because COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days; the 21-day interval accounts for this incubation period and provides for an additional seven days for thorough review, analysis, and preparation of modifications.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block?	It’s okay to go outside to go for a walk, to exercise, and participate in healthy activities as long as you **maintain a safe physical distance of six feet and gather only with members of your household.** You can also participate in activities at [outdoor recreational facilities](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds.pdf) that are allowed to open. [Parks may be closed](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/) to help slow the spread of the virus. Check with local officials about park closures in your area. Californians should not travel significant distances for recreation and should stay close to home.\n\nBelow is a list of some outdoor recreational activities.\n\n*   Badminton (singles)\n*   Throwing a baseball/softball\n*   BMX biking\n*   Canoeing (singles)\n*   Crabbing\n*   Cycling\n*   Exploring rock pools\n*   Gardening (not in groups)\n*   Golfing (doubles, only if cart has protective partition)\n*   Hiking (trails/ paths allowing distancing)\n*   Horse riding (singles)\n*   Jogging and running\n*   Kite boarding and kitesurfing\n*   Meditation\n*   Outdoor photography\n*   Picnics (with your household members only)\n*   Quad biking\n*   Rock climbing\n*   Roller skating and rollerblading\n*   Rowing (singles)\n*   Scootering (not in groups)\n*   Skateboarding (not in groups)\n*   Soft martial arts – tai chi, chi kung (not in groups)\n*   Surfing\n*   Tennis and table tennis (singles)\n*   Throwing a football, kicking a soccer ball (not in groups)\n*   Trail running\n*   Trampolining\n*   Tree climbing\n*   Volleyball (singles)\n*   Walk the dog\n*   Wash the car\n*   Watch the sunrise or sunset\n*   Yoga\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/

Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?	State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers [may continue to be closed](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30350) to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check [parks in your area before you travel](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/). Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face cloth covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.\n\nYou can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails & parking lots.\n\nFor information on National Parks, please the [National Park Service website](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I travel?	You can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks. Do not travel with someone who is sick.\n\nBefore travelling away from your community, consider these questions from the [Center for Disease Control (CDC) travel guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html):\n\n*   Is coronavirus spreading where you are traveling?\n*   Are you or those you are traveling with more likely to get very sick from coronavirus?\n*   Will you be able to keep 6 feet of physical distance from others during or after your trip?\n\nIf you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face cloth covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.  \n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/
Can I go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)?	Beginning June 11, [all DMV offices](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-reopens-remaining-field-offices-to-public/) are open to the public to help with appointments that require an in-person visit.

Should I use cloth face coverings or masks to protect against COVID-19?	Yes,  when you must leave home to conduct activities permitted under the current roadmap stage, you should wear a cloth face covering or mask. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released [Guidance on Use of Cloth Face Coverings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Face-Coverings-Guidance.aspx).\n\nThe cloth face coverings recommended are **not** medical grade respirators, such as N95 and surgical masks.\n\nThe guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be: \n\n*   Staying at home and physical distancing \n*   Washing hands frequently\n*   Avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands\n*   Avoiding being around people with COVID-19 symptoms\n\nThe use of cloth face coverings could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not have symptoms and may reinforce physical distancing.\n\nMore info: [Health care coverage](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
What is a cloth face covering?	A cloth face covering is [material that covers the nose and mouth](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A cloth face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.\n\nMore info: [Health care coverage](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/
How should I care for a cloth face covering?	It’s a good idea to [wash your cloth face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep cloth face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your cloth face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face.

How do I get a drive-through test?	There are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If your answers from the screener determine you are eligible at this time, you will receive details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll be informed via email or phone when your COVID-19 test results are available.\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
Why am I asked to create an account for drive-through testing using Verily’s Project Baseline?	For the Baseline COVID-19 Program to work, Verily needs a way to authenticate users to appropriately protect their information. Verily turned to Google for this service because Google Account provides best-in-class authentication. We ask that you link to an existing Google Account or create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address). This lets Verily authenticate your account, and securely and privately contact you during the screening and testing process. All the data provided by Baseline COVID-19 Program users for screening is stored separately and not directly linked to a user’s Google Account.\n\nMore info: [Testing and treatment](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/
