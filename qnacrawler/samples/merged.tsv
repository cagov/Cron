What is a loan guarantee?	A loan guarantee is a credit enhancement that helps mitigate the risk assumed by a lending institution when making a loan. With the Small Business Finance Center’s Disaster Relief Loan Guarantee Program, IBank agrees to guarantee up to 95% of the loan, removing the barriers to capital that often exist for small business borrowers that may not otherwise be eligible for traditional lending. This program also can assist those who may not be eligible for a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan.\n\nMore info: [Businesses and employers](https://covid19.ca.gov/business-and-employers/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/business-and-employers/	 	[]	false	[]	1

Should I wear a mask or face covering to protect against COVID-19?	Yes. You should wear face coverings whenever you are outside of your home, unless one of the exceptions described by the state applies to you. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Cloth masks can reduce your exposure to infectious droplets through filtration.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released [guidance for the use of face coverings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx).\n\nThe guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be: \n\n*   Maintain six feet of physical distance from others \n*   Wash hands frequently\n*   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands\n*   Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	136
What is a face covering?	A face covering, also known as a cloth mask, is [material that covers the nose and mouth](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	137
How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?	Multi-layer cloth masks can both block up to 50-70% of fine droplets and particles, and limit the forward spread of those that are not captured. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes. Cloth masks can also reduce your exposure to infectious droplets through filtration. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but complements them.\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	138
How should I care for a cloth mask or face covering?	It’s a good idea to [wash your face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard face coverings that:\n\n*   No longer cover the nose and mouth\n*   Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps\n*   Cannot stay on the face\n*   Have holes or tears in the fabric\n\nSee advice from the CDC on [how to select, wear, and clean your mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	139
Are face shields acceptable as face coverings to prevent spread of COVID-19?	Face shields are not recommended as a substitute for masks or face coverings. They primarily provide eye protection for the person wearing it. It is unknown what level of protection a face shield provides to people nearby.\n\n[CDPH has detailed recommendations](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/faceshield_handout.pdf) for situations where face shields are the only option.\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	140
Should I wear a mask on public transportation and at transportation hubs?	Yes. All passengers and staff must wear masks while on public transportation or at boarding points. This includes airplanes, ships, ferries, trains, subways, buses, taxis, and ride-shares. Masks should also be worn at transportation hubs and other locations where people board, like airports, bus or ferry terminals, train stations, and seaports.\n\n*   People must wear masks when traveling into, within, or out of the United States on public conveyances.\n*   Transportation staff should refuse to board anyone not wearing a mask and require all people onboard, whether passengers or employees, to wear masks for the duration of travel, except:\n    *   For brief periods while eating, drinking, or taking medication.\n    *   If the person is unconscious, incapacitated, unable to be awakened, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.\n    *   When it’s necessary to temporarily remove the mask to verify one’s identity such as during Transportation Security Administration screening or when asked to do so by the ticket or gate agent or any law enforcement official.\n    *   For children under the age of 2 years old.\n\nTransportation staff should ensure that any person on the vehicle wears a mask when boarding, disembarking, and for the duration of travel.\n\nFor more information, see: \n\n*   CDC: [Wear Face Masks on Public Transportation Conveyances and at Transportation Hubs](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html)\n*   [Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf) (PDF)\n*   CDPH: [Guidance for the Use of Face Coverings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx)\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	141
Is there any proof that masks are effective in preventing coronavirus infection?	Yes. The CDC has collected evidence on the [effectiveness of masks](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html). \n\nMasks create a barrier that helps prevent respiratory droplets from traveling into the air and onto other people when the wearer coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). Using a mask is important in settings where people are close to each other or where it’s difficult to keep physical distance from others.\n\nMore info: [Masks](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	142
Is blood plasma authorized as a COVID-19 treatment?	[The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-convalescent-plasma-potential-promising-covid-19-treatment) for convalescent plasma to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in making  COVID-19 illness shorter and less severe in some patients. The FDA also determined that the known and potential benefits of this plasma, when used to treat COVID-19, outweigh its known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments.\n\nMore info: [Survivors of COVID-19: Donate your plasma](https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/	 	[]	false	[]	143

Why can some activities and businesses open while others have to stay closed?	Activities and businesses that have a lower risk of spreading COVID-19 are allowed to open sooner. Higher-risk activities or businesses aren’t allowed until later tiers. An activity or business’s tier depends on whether it can:\n\n*   Accommodate mask wearing at all times (for example, eating and drinking requires removing masks)\n*   Allow physical distance between individuals from different households\n*   Limit the number of people per square foot\n*   Limit time that an individual is at the business or activity\n*   Limit time of exposure\n*   Limit mixing of people from different households\n*   Limit amount of physical interactions of visitors/patrons\n*   Increase airflow (such as operating outdoors or opening windows and doors) \n*   Limit activities that are known to increase virus spread (like singing, shouting and heavy breathing)\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/	 	[]	false	[]	152
What happened to the County Monitoring List?	On August 31, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy replaced the County Data Monitoring List for determining what business can and cannot open.\n\nSo why change? We learned a lot over the first several months of the pandemic about COVID-19 and how it spreads. For example, we know how much safer outdoor activities are than indoor ones and that it’s critical everyone wears a mask to limit the spread of the disease. This blueprint incorporates what we’ve learned.\n\nThe Blueprint for a Safer Economy is the next evolution of our response. We’ve revised the criteria and the time between changing tiers. We’ve made it easy for counties to see how changes affect the disease’s trajectory and for businesses and customers to plan ahead. And we’ve given Californians one place to look up whether a business or activity is allowed near them.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/	 	[]	false	[]	153

Schools in the Widespread (purple) tier aren’t permitted to reopen for in-person instruction, unless they receive a waiver from their local health department for grades TK-6. However, they may provide supervision of children in accordance with the [cohorts guidance](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#cohort-guidance).\n\nSchools can reopen for in-person instruction once their county has been in the Substantial (red) tier for two weeks. Tiers take effect the day after assignment. For example, if a county moves to the Substantial (red) tier on Tuesday, September 8, and stays there for two weeks, schools can open Wednesday, September 23.\n\nSchools that have reopened for in-person instruction are not required to close if their county moves back to the Widespread (purple) tier.\n\nLearn more about [guidance for schools](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#schools-guidance).\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/	 	[]	false	[]	155
What can I do to help my county reach a lower tier?	*   Stay home except for essential services.\n*   Wear a mask in public.\n*   Wash your hands regularly.\n*   Keep at least six feet of physical distance when in public.\n*   Limit mixing with people you don’t live with.\n\nMore info: [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/	 	[]	false	[]	156
Why is this Regional Stay Home Order being implemented now?	We are in the midst of an unprecedented surge in cases and hospitalizations in California and across the country. Without immediate action many hospital Intensive Care Units (ICU) will reach capacity before the end of the year. ICU beds are a critical resource for individuals who need the most advanced support and care. Given the nationwide surge, the ability to add surge ICU capacity is limited by availability of ICU nurses and physicians. We need to protect our hospital capacity so those who need care—for such things as cancer treatment, heart attacks, and strokes—can get it. By taking this action we are saving lives, protecting our health care delivery system and keeping those at highest risk and essential workers safe.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	157
What does the Regional Stay Home Order do?	The Regional Stay Home Order instructs Californians to stay at home as much as possible and to stop mixing between households that can lead to COVID-19 spread. It allows access to critical services and allows outdoor activities to preserve Californians’ physical and mental health. The Regional Stay Home Order will help stop the surge and prevent overwhelming regional ICU capacity. \n\nUnder the order, the following sectors are allowed to remain open with safety precautions: \n\n*   Critical infrastructure (when remote option is not possible)\n*   Schools\n*   Non-urgent medical and dental care\n*   Child care and pre-K\n\nThe following sectors will have additional modifications in addition to 100% masking and physical distancing:\n\n*   **Outdoor recreational facilities:** Allow outdoor operation only for the purpose of facilitating physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise, without any food, drink or alcohol sales. Additionally, overnight stays at campgrounds will not be permitted.\n*   **Retail:** Allow indoor operation at 20% capacity, and 35% of capacity for standalone grocery stores, with entrance metering and no eating or drinking in the stores. Additionally, special hours should be instituted for seniors and others with chronic conditions or compromised immune systems. \n*   **Shopping centers**: Allow indoor access at 20% capacity with entrance metering and no eating or drinking in the stores. Additionally, special hours should be instituted for seniors and others with chronic conditions or compromised immune systems.\n*   **Hotels and lodging:** Allow for COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, provide accommodation for essential workers, or providing housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.\n*   **Restaurants:** Allow only for take out or delivery.\n*   **Offices:** Allow remote only except for critical infrastructure sectors where remote working is not possible. \n*   **Places of worship and political expression:** Allow outdoor activities only.\n*   **Entertainment production:** Industries, studios, and other related establishments such as establishments that provide content for professional broadcast can operate without live audiences.\n\nIn any region that triggers a Regional Stay Home Order because it drops below 15% ICU capacity all operations in the following sectors must be closed (except to the extent that their operations fall within critical infrastructure):\n\n*   Hair salons and barbershops\n*   Personal care services\n*   Museums, zoos, and aquariums\n*   Movie theaters (except drive-in)\n*   Wineries, bars, breweries, and distilleries (with exception for production, manufacturing, distribution, and retail sale for off-site consumption)\n*   Family entertainment centers\n*   Cardrooms and satellite wagering\n*   Limited services\n*   Live audience sports\n*   Amusement parks\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	158
When does the Regional Stay Home Order take effect?	The Regional Stay Home Order will be implemented regionally once there is less than 15% ICU capacity remaining in the designated region. After three weeks from the start of the Regional Stay Home Order in the region, one of two situations would occur:\n\n1.  The order will end in a region if the region’s ICU capacity projected out four weeks (from day 22 after the Regional Stay Home Order started in the region) is above or equal to 15%. Each county in the region will then be assigned to a tier based on the Blueprint for a Safer Economy and the rules of the Blueprint will apply again.\n2.  The order will remain in effect in a region if its ICU capacity projected out four weeks (from day 22 after the Regional Stay Home Order started in the region) is less than 15%. The order will remain in effect until the region’s projected ICU capacity is equal or greater than 15%. This would be assessed approximately twice a week.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	159
How do I find out what the hospital/ICU capacity is in my region or county?	The state will post [ICU capacity by region](#icu-capacity) daily. The state also maintains a publicly-available dashboard on [hospital and ICU capacity by county](https://covid19.ca.gov/state-dashboard/).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	160
How is daily regional available ICU capacity calculated?	Hospitals are required to submit information on the total number of available staffed ICU beds daily. This includes both existing staffed ICU beds and staffed ICU surge beds. To calculate regional ICU capacity the total number of adult ICU beds is calculated by removing neonatal ICU beds (NICU) and pediatric intensive care unit beds (PICU) as well as standardizing current adult ICU capacity. Consistent with the goal of the Regional Stay Home Order, this calculation ensures that sufficient ICU bed capacity is available for COVID and non-COVID related conditions.   \n\nAs of December 4, 2020 the ICU capacity is calculated as described above.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	161
How does the Regional Stay Home Order impact schools?	The Order does not modify [existing state guidance regarding K-12 schools](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Guidance.aspx).\n\nSchools that are currently open are able to continue to provide in-person instruction on school sites. \n\n*   Schools that are currently operating under an elementary school waiver are able to continue to provide instruction to students on school sites.\n*   Schools that reopened while their county was in a less restrictive tier are able to continue to provide instruction to students on school sites.\n*   All schools that have not yet reopened for in-person instruction are able to continue to serve small cohorts of students (e.g., students with disabilities) following [CDPH Guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx).\n\nSchools are still required to follow the Schools Guidance issued by CDPH which outlines requirements for safe conditions, testing and tracing. Schools may be required to close if certain percentages of staff and students are diagnosed with COVID-19. All [existing guidance applicable to schools](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Guidance.aspx) can be found on the CDPH website.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	162
Are playgrounds open?	Playgrounds may remain open to facilitate physically distanced personal health and wellness through outdoor exercise.  Playgrounds located on schools that remain open for in-person instruction, and not accessible by the general public, may remain open and must follow [guidance for schools and school-based programs (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-schools--en.pdf).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	163
How does the Regional Stay Home Order impact travel?	Hotels and lodging cannot accept or honor out-of-state reservations for non-essential travel, unless the reservation is for at least the minimum time period required for quarantine and the persons identified in the reservation will quarantine in the hotel or lodging entity until after that time period has expired. \n\nWhen the Regional Stay Home Order is in effect in a region, hotels and lodging can only offer accommodation for COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, accommodation for essential workers, or providing housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations. \n\nAdditionally, the [Travel Advisory](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx) remains in effect.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	164
Under a Regional Stay Home Order, can hotels, vacation rentals, and short-term lodging sites accept reservations?	When any California region is under a Regional Stay Home Order, no hotel or lodging entity in California can accept or honor out of state reservations for non-essential travel, unless the reservation is for at least the minimum time period required for quarantine and the persons identified in the reservation will quarantine in the hotel or lodging entity until after that time period has expired.\n\nAdditionally, hotels and lodging entities in a county under a Regional Stay Home Order cannot accept or honor in-state reservations for non-essential travel.\n\nHotels or other commercial and residential buildings may offer lodging for essential functions and travel including COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, accommodation for essential workers, or housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	165

Will the state open up Alternative Care Facilities/surge hospitals in the hardest hit regions to reduce stress on hospitals?	Yes. Currently the state has 11 alternative care sites that could be activated in 24-96 hours should they be needed. The total number of beds in these alternative care sites is 1,862. In addition to the alternative care sites the state has 22 California Medical Stations, which are 50 bed field hospitals, in our cache that can be rapidly deployed. In total we have capacity of approximately 3,000 additional medical beds currently available beyond what we have in the hospital system. Information on the number of alternative care sites and the number of surge beds in use can be found here: [https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19BedSurgeDashboard/BedSurge?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no](https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19BedSurgeDashboard/BedSurge?:embed=y&:showVizHome=no)\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	167

Who will be responsible for enforcing the Regional Stay Home Order?	All Californians are being asked to follow this order to protect themselves, their families, and their communities. The order provides a new tool for local officials & law enforcement personnel to use to protect public health and safety, should they need it. \n\nThe State COVID-19 Enforcement Taskforce will continue to work closely with local officials to implement the order and coordinate strategic, targeted enforcement actions with the goal of adjusting behavior, interrupting high-risk actions and defiance of public health orders, and restoring compliance.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	177
Under what authority is the Regional Stay Home Order being done?	Several Health and Safety Code provisions (listed in the order itself) authorize the California Department of Public Health to take action necessary to protect public health. In addition, multiple executive orders require compliance with such orders. For example, on March 12, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-25-20, which included as operative paragraph one, “\[a\]ll residents are to heed any orders and guidance of state and local public health officials, including but not limited to the imposition of social distancing measures, to combat the spread of COVID-19.” Further, on March 19, 2020, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-33-20, in which he reiterated his directive that all residents immediately heed state public health directives (which, in that Order, was in the context of the stay-at-home order).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	178
Where can I get resources or information to help encourage those in my community to adhere to this Regional Stay Home Order?

Are gyms required to close in regions where the Regional Stay Home Order is in effect?	Gyms in counties in a region that is impacted by the order must stop indoor operations. Outdoor gyms meet the essential workforce definition of an outdoor recreational facility for the purpose of facilitating personal health through physically distanced outdoor exercise and may continue operations.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	180
Under the Regional Stay Home Order, retail operations are limited to 20% capacity (or 35% for standalone grocery stores). How is this calculated?	Capacity is based on fire department occupancy limit. In most cases the capacity limit does NOT include staff under the fire code; individual premises will know from their own individualized fire department occupancy limits whether staff are included. Trained staff serve as safety facilitators and help customers evacuate in an emergency. These same staff can assist in the public health emergency to enforce public health protocols. Staff also play an important role by ensuring customers are assisted quickly at the point of sale to avoid crowding and ensure appropriate physical distancing.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	181
Can a county choose to be more restrictive than the State’s Regional Stay Home Order?	The State’s Regional Stay Home Order sets forth minimum restrictions necessary based on regional conditions. The Local Health Officer may determine if and when the situation within a given local jurisdiction warrants measures that are more restrictive than the State’s Regional Stay Home Order and retains authority to implement such measures.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	182
When does the Stay Home Order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?	The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.\n\nThe order was modified on [May 4, 2020](https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.4.20-EO-N-60-20.pdf). On [August 28, 2020](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/) the State released the Blueprint for a Safer Economy to permit gradual reopening of certain businesses and activities.\n\nAs of November 21, 2020, Californians in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier are directed to [stop non-essential activities between 10PM and 5AM](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order.aspx). On December 21, 2020, this was [extended](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Supplement-to-Limited-Stay-At-Home-Order.aspx) to counties under the Regional Stay Home Order.\n\nSee the [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/) for state restrictions in your area.

Are swimming pools open?	Outdoor swimming pools are allowed to open in all counties in California. Outdoor pools must close slides, rides, or other attractions. \n\nIndoor swimming pools are closed in counties in the [Widespread (purple) or Substantial (red) tiers](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy).\n\nDrowning prevention classes, including swim lessons with certified instructors, are permitted in indoor and outdoor swimming pools in all tiers, as they are deemed essential.\n\nWater parks, both indoor and outdoor, remain closed throughout the state.\n\nWhen out of the water, masks or face coverings should be worn. Physical distancing should be practiced at all times. Group gatherings are not allowed. Bring your own towel, and don’t share items that are worn on the face (like goggles, nose clips, or snorkels). Pool operators should follow heightened cleaning and safety guidance in response to COVID-19. See sector guidance for [gyms and fitness centers](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-fitness--en.pdf) and [campgrounds and outdoor recreation](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	187
I heard that in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier, we should be home by 10:00 PM. Why?	There has been an unprecedented increase in COVID-19 cases in California. Reducing movement and mixing between people is critical to lowering transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths.\n\nThe [Limited Stay Home Order](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/limited-stay-at-home-order-qa.aspx), announced on November 21, 2020, and a [supplemental order](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Supplement-to-Limited-Stay-At-Home-Order.aspx), signed on December 21, 2020, directs all individuals in counties in the Widespread (purple) tier or under the Regional Stay Home Order be at home by 10:00 PM, and stay there until 5:00 AM the next day. Exceptions include, for example:\n\n*   Individuals going home or to their workplace\n*   Individuals getting medical assistance\n*   Those who work in critical infrastructure during these hours\n*   Unsheltered persons\n\nInteractions during these hours are usually social in nature, and reducing those interactions helps reduce the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThis order is in effect until such time as the [Regional Stay Home Order](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Regional-Stay-at-Home-Order-.aspx) has terminated in all Regions of the State of California..\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- curfew -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	188
What is the relationship between the Stay Home Order and these questions and answers?	The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	189
Is it safe to shop at open businesses?	The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal.

If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?	Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top)). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	192
Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn’t complying?	They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the [Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	193
Can I walk my dog? Take my pet to the vet?	You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to wear a face covering and distance yourself at least 6 feet from other pets and owners.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	194
Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?	State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers [may continue to be closed](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30350) to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check [parks in your area before you travel](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/). Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently. See the California Department of Public Health’s [Travel Advisory](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx) for more info.\n\nYou can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails and parking lots.\n\n[Outdoor playgrounds](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#campgrounds-outdoor-recreation) may also open if they are operated by city, state, county, or federal government. Your local health department may have additional restrictions. Check [your county’s COVID-19 website](https://covid19.ca.gov/get-local-information/#County-websites) for information on playgrounds in your community.\n\nFor information on National Parks, please the [National Park Service website](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/news/public-health-update.htm).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- park, visitor center, travel, museum, RV parks, recreation, outdoor recreation, sports, RV, tent camping, tent camp, fish, beach, lake, river, event, outdoor event, event planning, hike, walk, bike, exercise, nature, bird watching, public -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	195
Are there travel restrictions within California?	To prevent further spread of COVID-19, Californians should not travel significant distances and should stay close to home as much as possible. See the California Department of Public Health’s [Travel Advisory](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx) for more info.\n\nStay in your county if you can. Don’t drive more than 2-3 hours.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	196
I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?	There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.  \n\nAdditionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.\n\nIf collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars. The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households. Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.  \n\nWhenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.\n\nIf you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	197
Can I engage in political rallies and protest gatherings?	Yes, although in-person protests and rallies present special public health concerns for high risk of COVID-19 transmission. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protests and rallies carries an especially high risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities must wear face coverings at all times.\n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _outdoor_ protests and rallies as long as you maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. In addition, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. \n\nIn counties in the [Widespread (purple) tier](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/), indoor protests and rallies are not currently permitted. In other counties, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _indoor_ protests and rallies as long as (1) attendance is limited as required by the [relevant restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) on places of worship and local health restrictions, (2) physical distancing of at least 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of at least 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	198
How do I vote?	**[Elections are an essential activity](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/CDPH-to-SOS-Letter-from-Acting-HO-Aug-18-1.pdf).** The Governor has issued [executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/). Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Most counties will provide [three days of early voting](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/) in-person starting the Saturday before the election. Open ballot drop-box locations will be available between October 6 and November 3, 2020. Existing laws addressing the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections remain in effect except where suspended by Executive Order. Find [guidance for the safe administration of elections](https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ccrov/pdf/2020/july/20154jl.pdf) during COVID-19.\n\n Visit [online voter registration](https://registertovote.ca.gov/) to register to vote or check your voter registration status. \n\nPractice physical distancing and follow other applicable public health directives while engaged in election-related activities. These include collection and drop-off of ballots, and collection of signatures to qualify candidates or measures for the ballot.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	199
Can I go to church?	Yes. Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with [modifications for safety (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). In counties in the [Widespread (purple)](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) tier, indoor services in places of worship must be discontinued but outdoor and online services are permitted.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	200
Can I practice my religious faith?	Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions that support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	201
What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?	Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at [guidance for places of worship (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship may only open indoor operations when permitted by [relevant local restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) and must comply with all applicable attendance limitations and guidance requirements.\n\nLocal Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on _outdoor_ attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document.\n\nThis limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	202
Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?	Yes.  Outdoor activities are permitted, and indoor activities are permitted if they comply with the [cohort guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	203
When will current conditions change for places of worship?	The California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will regularly review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	204
Are weddings allowed?	Yes, but only wedding ceremonies are allowed, not receptions. Wedding ceremonies should follow the guidance for [Places of worship or cultural ceremonies](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship). As required by that guidance, social distancing should be practiced by all attendees. Wear masks, wash hands frequently, and keep 6 feet from anyone you don’t live with. \n\nCeremonies have restrictions on their setting or capacity, depending on your county’s tier status:\n\n*   Widespread (purple) tier:  \n    Outdoors only\n*   Substantial (red) tier:  \n    May be held indoors, but with max capacity of 25% or 100 people, whichever is fewer\n*   Moderate (orange) tier:  \n    May be held indoors, but with max capacity of 50% or 200 people, whichever is fewer\n*   Minimal (yellow) tier:  \n    May be held indoors, but with max capacity of 50%\n\nWhile wedding receptions are not permitted, consider safer options like sharing your wedding online via video conference (Zoom, Google Meet, or other platforms). This protects all your loved ones, especially those at high risk like seniors or people with chronic conditions.\n\nSee more details in guidance for [Places of worship and cultural ceremonies](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	205
Are gatherings for musical, theatrical, and artistic performances permitted?	Gatherings for live musical, theatrical, and other artistic performances are permitted outdoors subject to guidance that is being prepared by CDPH. Because such gatherings frequently involve the mixing of people from different communities creating a high risk of transmission of COVID-19, until that guidance is issued, such gatherings are  allowed only in counties in the “Moderate” (orange) or “Minimal” (yellow) risk levels of the [Blueprint for a Safer Economy](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/).  In addition, performances are permitted only if, in the exercise of their discretion, the relevant local or city health officer approves the precautions taken to ensure the safety of audience members, performers and others connected with the performance.  Performances may have no more than 50 persons in the audience in counties in the “Moderate” risk level and no more than 100 in counties in the “Minimal” risk level.  If a local or city health officer approves a performance, the officer shall notify CDPH of the approval within two business days.   \n\nDuring approved performances, all audience members and others not performing must wear masks, and audience members from different households must be spaced at least six feet apart when seated or otherwise viewing the performance. Performers who are not wearing face coverings must be at least six feet apart from each other. \n\nApproval is not required for a live musical, theatrical, or artistic performance if, in aggregate, members of no more than three households attend, perform, or otherwise are involved in the performance.\n\nAdditionally, live performances are permitted to the extent that they are permitted by applicable sector guidance for the venue hosting such a performance (such as restaurants, wineries, or bars).\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	206
Can I go to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV)?	Yes, but first check if an in-person visit is required. Several deadlines have been extended, and many [DMV services can be accessed online](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv-online/).\n\n##### Extended deadlines\n\nDMV has [extended deadlines](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/driver-licenses-identification-cards/driver-license-id-card-online-renewal/) for:\n\n*   Driver’s license renewals for drivers of any age\n*   ID card or REAL ID renewals\n*   Renewals for commercial licenses, endorsements, and certificates\n*   Vehicle registrations\n*   Driver’s license permits\n*   Commercial learner’s permits\n\n##### Online or by-mail services\n\nDMV offers many services that can be handled online, including simple vehicle registration, renewing a driver’s license, getting a duplicate license, and more. See [DMV Online Services](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv-online/).\n\nSome DMV services that used to require an in-person office visit can now be accessed online, including driver’s license renewals, vehicle registrations, title transfers, temporary driver’s license extensions, commercial driver’s license renewals, and more. See [DMV Virtual Field Office](https://virtual.dmv.ca.gov/).\n\nStill more services can be accessed by mail. See the [DMV website](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/) for details.\n\n##### In-person visits\n\nBeginning June 11, [all DMV offices](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-reopens-remaining-field-offices-to-public/) are open to the public for appointments that require an in-person visit. You will be required to wear a mask and must remain 6 feet apart in line.\n\nOn December 14, 2020, commercial and non-commercial driving tests were suspended until at least December 28. Those with canceled appointments were notified. Motorcycle driving tests were not canceled. See the [DMV Field Office Reopenings](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/covid-19-relief-information/field-office-reopenings/) page for details.\n\nIn-person appointments are limited to:\n\n*   Commercial driver’s license transactions including applications, medical reports and administering knowledge and vision tests.\n*   Paying registration for a vehicle impounded because of registration-related issues\n*   Reinstating a suspended or revoked driver license\n*   Applying for a reduced-fee or no-fee identification card\n*   Applying for a disabled person parking placard (though this can also be done by mail)\n*   Adding an ambulance certificate or firefighter endorsement to a driver license\n*   Verifying a transit training document to drive a transit bus\n*   Processing DMV Express customers for REAL ID transactions, if time and space allow\n*   Vehicle verifications\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	207
Can I get my car smog checked?	It depends. Some smog check locations may be closed. The [Bureau of Automotive Repair](https://www.bar.ca.gov/COVID-19_Impacts_on_BAR_Programs_and_Services.aspx) advises drivers to still pay DMV vehicle registration fees to avoid any late fees. However, you will not receive your new registration or year sticker until the smog information has been received by DMV. Once state and local orders or directives are no longer in effect, you can then obtain the required smog check certificate to complete the DMV vehicle registration process.\n\nMore info: [About COVID-19 restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	208

What are the similarities and differences between Influenza (flu) and COVID-19?	Influenza (flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they’re caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by a [new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#Basics) and flu is caused by [influenza viruses](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/index.htm). \n\nThe symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar. It is hard to tell the difference between them without testing.\n\nCases of COVID-19 and flu can have anything from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe symptoms. Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include:\n\n*   Fever or chills\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\n*   Fatigue (tiredness)\n*   Sore throat\n*   Runny or stuffy nose\n*   Muscle pain or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   Vomiting and diarrhea (more common in children than adults)\n\nThe major difference between them is COVID-19 may include change in or loss of taste or smell.\n\nThe CDC has more information about [similarities and differences between the flu and COVID-19.](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/flu-vs-covid19.htm)\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	211
Who is at risk of infection with coronavirus, which causes COVID-19?	Anyone can get infected with coronavirus. Currently, those at greatest risk of infection are persons who have had prolonged, unprotected [close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) (within 6 feet for at least 15 minutes over a 24-hour period) with a patient with confirmed coronavirus infection, regardless of whether the patient has symptoms. Those frequently in group settings (like homeless shelters, assisted living facilities, or college dormitories) are at increased risk of acquiring infection because of the increased likelihood of close contact. Those who live in or have recently been to areas with sustained transmission may also be at higher risk of infection. Everyone can reduce the risk to themselves and others by:\n\n*   [**Staying home and isolating**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html) **from others when sick**\n*   Wearing a mask \n*   Practicing physical distancing \n*   Washing their hands often, and \n*   Taking [other prevention measures](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html).\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	212
What is the risk of children getting sick with COVID-19?	Children can be infected with coronavirus and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain [underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#children-underlying-conditions) and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called [multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/children/mis-c.html).\n\nFor more information for parents or caregivers of children, see the CDC’s page on [Children and Teens](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/caring-for-children.html)  and their [COVID-19 Parental Resources Kit](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/parental-resource-kit/childhood.html).\n\nFor more information about how people get sick with the virus that causes COVID-19, see [How COVID-19 Spreads](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html).\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	213
What should I do if my child has COVID-19 symptoms?	If your child gets sick with symptoms of COVID-19, take these steps: \n\n*   **Keep your child home**\n*   **Call your child’s doctor** to discuss whether they need to be tested for COVID-19. \n*   If you are unsure if your child’s symptoms are related to COVID-19, visit [Coronavirus self-checker](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/coronavirus-self-checker.html). This online tool will help you decide when to seek testing or medical care for your child. \n*   If you don’t have health insurance or a regular doctor, call Medi-Nurse.

What are the long term effects of COVID-19?	The disease has not existed long enough for us to really know. But as the pandemic unfolds, we are learning that many organs besides the lungs are affected by COVID-19, and there are many ways it can affect someone’s health.\n\nWhile most people with COVID-19 recover and return to normal health, some patients can have symptoms that can last for weeks or even months after recovery from acute illness. Even people who are not hospitalized and who have mild illness can experience persistent or late symptoms. \n\nThe most commonly reported long-term symptoms include:\n\n*   Fatigue\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Cough\n*   Joint pain\n*   Chest pain\n\nOther reported long-term symptoms include:\n\n*   Difficulty with thinking and concentration (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”)\n*   Depression\n*   Muscle pain\n*   Headache\n*   Intermittent fever\n*   Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)\n\nMore serious long-term complications appear to be less common but have been reported. These have been noted to affect different organ systems in the body. These include:\n\n*   Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle\n*   Respiratory: lung function abnormalities\n*   Renal: acute kidney injury\n*   Dermatologic: rash, hair loss\n*   Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems\n*   Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood\n\nThe long-term significance of these effects is not yet known.\n\nSee the CDC’s [Long-Term Effects of COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html) for more details.\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	215
Can people who recover from COVID-19 be re-infected?	We don’t yet know. The duration of immunity to coronavirus infection is not yet understood. Patients infected with similar viruses are unlikely to be re-infected in the months after they recover. But we don’t yet know if  similar immune protection happens in patients with COVID-19.\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	216
Who needs to quarantine?	You should [quarantine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html) if you have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19. If you tested positive for COVID-19 in the 3 months prior to the close contact but do not currently have symptoms, you do not need to quarantine or be tested again. If you develop symptoms, you may need to quarantine and be tested again.\n\nYou have had [close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) if:\n\n*   You were within 6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period\n*   You provided care at home to someone who is sick with COVID-19\n*   You had direct physical contact with the person (like hugging or kissing them)\n*   You shared eating or drinking utensils\n*   They sneezed, coughed, or somehow got respiratory droplets on you\n\nPersons arriving in California from other states or countries, including returning California residents, should practice [self-quarantine](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/self-quarantine-instructions.pdf) for at least 10 days after arrival and follow the recommendations in CDPH’s [COVID-19 Quarantine Guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Quarantine.aspx). These persons should limit their interactions to their immediate household.

Can COVID-19 be spread by airborne transmission?	It’s possible. Under certain conditions, people with COVID-19 seem to have infected others who were more than 6 feet away. These transmissions occurred within enclosed spaces that had inadequate ventilation. Sometimes the infected person was breathing heavily, for example while singing or exercising.\n\n*   Under these circumstances, scientists believe that the amount of infectious smaller droplets and particles produced by the people with COVID-19 became concentrated enough to spread the virus to other people. The people who were infected were in the same space during the same time or shortly after the person with COVID-19 had left.\n*   It is much more common for the virus to spread through [close contact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/contact-tracing/contact-tracing-plan/appendix.html#contact) with a person who has COVID-19 than through airborne transmission.\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	218
How do I protect myself and others from COVID-19?	The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to coronavirus. You can take steps to slow the spread.\n\n*   [Stay at least 6 feet away from others](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/social-distancing.html), whenever possible. This is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.\n*   [Cover your mouth and nose with a mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) when around others. This helps reduce the risk of spread both by close contact and by airborne transmission.\n*   [Wash your hands](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html) often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n*   [Avoid crowded indoor spaces](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/deciding-to-go-out.html) and [ensure indoor spaces are properly ventilated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/disinfecting-your-home.html#ventilation) by bringing in outdoor air as much as possible.

Can air conditioning spread COVID-19 from one room to another?	There is no evidence that COVID-19 spreads indoors through air conditioning. There are a wide variety of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Well-designed HVAC systems can actually help reduce risk. Since the system filters air as it circulates, it adds cleaner air to the space. Introduction of fresh outdoor air dilutes the concentration of infectious particles. Air conditioning is also necessary in some areas to protect from excessive heat. For more information, see [ASHRAE guidelines for homeowners and HVAC professionals](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources). \n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	220
What do I need to know about COVID-19 and wildfire smoke?	Air pollutants from wildfire smoke can irritate the lungs, cause inflammation, weaken your immune system, and increase your risk of respiratory infections like COVID-19. Also, wildfire smoke exposure can worsen COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes.\n\nKeep in mind that some respiratory symptoms from wildfire smoke exposure and COVID-19 may be similar. These include cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing.\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms that are unrelated to smoke exposure include fever or chills, muscle or body aches, and diarrhea. If you think you may have COVID-19, contact your doctor.\n\nThe CDC has more detailed information about [Wildfire Smoke and COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/smoke-faq.html).\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	221

Is there an over-the-counter COVID-19 test I can take at home?	Yes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/media/144457/download) for an over-the-counter fully at-home diagnostic test for COVID-19. The test is authorized for individuals two years of age or older, including those not showing symptoms.\n\nThe home test is a rapid, lateral flow antigen test, a type of test that runs a liquid sample along a surface with reactive molecules. The FDA allows it to be sold in places like drug stores, where a patient can buy it, swab their nose, run the test and find out their results in as little as 20 minutes. \n\nIndividuals with positive results should:\n\n*   Self-isolate\n*   Seek additional care from their health care provider\n\nIndividuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider. It is possible to get a negative test result and still be infected with coronavirus.\n\n  \nFor more information, see the [**FDA news release**](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-antigen-test-first-over-counter-fully-home-diagnostic)**.**\n\nMore info: [Testing](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/	 	[]	false	[]	234

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an [Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/media/143810/download) for an at-home COVID-19 diagnostic self-test. The authorization is for home use with self-collected nasal swab samples in individuals aged 14 and older. This test is currently authorized for prescription use only. \n\nThe test works by swirling the self-collected sample swab in a vial that is then placed in the test unit. In 30 minutes or less, the results can be read directly from the test unit’s light-up display. \n\nIndividuals with positive results should:\n\n*   Self-isolate\n*   Seek additional care from their health care provider\n\nIndividuals who test negative and experience COVID-like symptoms should follow up with their health care provider. It is possible to get a negative test result and still be infected with coronavirus.\n\n  \nFor more information, see the [**FDA news release**](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-first-covid-19-test-self-testing-home)**.**\n\nMore info: [Testing](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/	 	[]	false	[]	235
How long does it take for coronavirus test results to come back?	Turnaround time for coronavirus test results is usually less than two days. Approximately two-thirds are returned within a day and more than 85% are available within two days.\n\nThis turnaround time includes shipping time. So for labs that process home testing kits, turnaround time may depend on when an individual mails back their kit.\n\nIf you haven’t received your test results and it’s been several days, contact your healthcare provider, testing service, or local health department.  \n  \nRead more at [California’s COVID-19 Testing Task Force](https://testing.covid19.ca.gov/).\n\nMore info: [Testing](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/	 	[]	false	[]	236

Once tested, you’ll get an email or phone call with your COVID-19 test results.\n\nMore info: [Testing](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/	 	[]	false	[]	240
Why am I asked to create an account for testing with Verily?	Verily needs a way to authenticate and protect user information. They turned to Google for this service, because Google accounts have best-in-class authentication. Simply link to an existing Google account or create a new one (which you can do with any email address). Then Verily can contact you securely during the screening and testing process. All data collected by Verily is kept private and is not linked to a user’s Google account.\n\nMore info: [Testing](https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/testing-and-treatment/	 	[]	false	[]	241
