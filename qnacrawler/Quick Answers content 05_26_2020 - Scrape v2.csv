"If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?","Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker.For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth below).And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and **do not gather with any number of people who are not members of your household.**\n\n### Protected activities",Can I leave my house if I am not an essential worker or if my job industry has not reopened?,,,,Kayla,,,,,,https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,,[],FALSE,[],93
Can I engage in political protest?,"Yes, as explained below, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times. \n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person protests as long as (1)  attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2) physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of six feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed at least once every 21 days, beginning May 25, 2020. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.",,,,,Kayla,,,,,,https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,,[],FALSE,[],94
How do I vote?,"Elections are an essential activity, and the [Governor has issued executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/). Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. The Secretary of State and the California Department of Public Health are working on additional guidance to ensure that all Californians are able to participate in elections safely. Existing laws address the use of vote-by-mail ballots in California elections, and those laws remain in effect unless otherwise noted.\n\nOf course, whenever you engage in any permissible activity—including the collection and drop-off of ballots, or other election-related activities—be mindful of physical distancing and other measures to protect yourself and those around you.",,,,,Kayla,,,,,,https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,,[],FALSE,[],95
Can I practice my religious faith?,"Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer  began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.",,,"church, worship, religion, religious, faith, gathering",,Kayla,,,,,,https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,,[],FALSE,[],96
What conditions must be met to resume religious services at places of worship?,"Full information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at[ guidance for places of worship.](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf) Additionally conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity and it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, congregants engaging in singing, particularly in the choir, and group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship must therefore limit attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. This limitation will be in effect for the first 21-days of a county public health department’s approval of religious services and cultural ceremonies activities at places of worship within their jurisdictions.",,,"church, worship, religion, religious, faith, gathering",,Kayla,,,,,,https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,,[],FALSE,[],97

When will these conditions change for places of worship?,"Every 21 days, the California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. This is because COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days; the 21-day interval accounts for this incubation period and provides for an additional seven days for thorough review, analysis, and preparation of modifications.",When will the limits for places of worship be lifted?,,"church, worship, religion, religious, faith, gathering",,Kayla,,,,,,https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/,,[],FALSE,[],99

Frequently asked questions (Project Baseline),"#### **How do I get a drive-through test?**\n\nThere are two steps to this process: screening and testing. First, you will create an account and take the online screener. If your answers from the screener determine you are eligible at this time, you will receive details on how and where to get tested. Once tested, you’ll be informed via email or phone when your COVID-19 test results are available.\n\n#### **Why am I asked to create an account? **\n\nFor the Baseline COVID-19 Program to work, Verily needs a way to authenticate users to appropriately protect their information. Verily turned to Google for this service because Google Account provides best-in-class authentication. We ask that you link to an existing Google Account or create a new Google Account (which can be done with any email address). This lets Verily authenticate your account, and securely and privately contact you during the screening and testing process. All the data provided by Baseline COVID-19 Program users for screening is stored separately and not directly linked to a user’s Google Account.","1) Header above questions and answers is shown as question but website has correct Q/As
