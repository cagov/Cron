Can air conditioning spread COVID-19 from one room to another?	There is no evidence that COVID-19 spreads indoors through air conditioning. There are a wide variety of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Well-designed HVAC systems can actually help reduce risk. Since the system filters air as it circulates, it adds cleaner air to the space. Introduction of fresh outdoor air dilutes the concentration of infectious particles. Air conditioning is also necessary in some areas to protect from excessive heat. For more information, see [ASHRAE guidelines for homeowners and HVAC professionals](https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/resources). \n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	1

What people at higher risk, seniors over 65 or compromised immune systems, should do?	If you are at higher risk, you should take extra precautions to protect yourself: \n\n*   **Stay home.** It’s the most important thing you can do.\n*   **Avoid contact with people who are sick.** Isolate anyone sick in your home in a separate room, if possible.\n*   **Get food brought to your house** through family, social, or commercial networks. Wipe off containers with disinfectant wipes.\n*   **Listen to public health officials.** They may recommend community actions to reduce exposure in times of local outbreak.\n\nMore info: [Symptoms and risks](https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/	 	[]	false	[]	5

What is the relationship between the stay home order and these questions and answers?	The Governor has ordered Californians to obey the directives of the State Public Health Officer. Those directives take many forms; they include specific materials linked on this page, as well as these questions and answers. These questions and answers are directives from the State Public Health Officer, and have the same force and effect as other State Public Health Officer directives.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	8
When does the stay home order go into effect and how long will we stay home? What areas of the state are covered?	The order went into effect on Thursday, March 19, 2020. The order is in place until further notice. It covers the whole state of California.\n\nAs of May 8, the stay home order was modified. In addition to essential activity, retail is allowed, along with the infrastructure to support it. As of May 12, offices, limited services, and outdoor museums are also permitted to open.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	9
Is it safe to shop at open businesses?	The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal. That is why every business permitted to open should take every step humanly possible to reduce the risk of infection by following these [state guidelines](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#top).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	10

How does the stay home order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?	This is a statewide order. Counties can have more restrictive criteria and different closures. See [your county’s status](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	12
If I am not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker, can I still leave the house?	Yes. As described in more detail elsewhere in applicable state public health directives (including on this page), there are a wide range of circumstances in which you may leave your home or other place of residence, even if you are not an Essential Critical Infrastructure Worker. For example, you may leave your home to work at any business or other entity that is allowed to open, to engage in in-person worship and protest activities consistent with public health directives, to patronize local businesses, or to care for friends or family members who require assistance (as set forth under [Health care](https://covid19.ca.gov/healthcare/#top)). And errands like these are not the only reasons you may leave your home: you may also leave your home with or without a specific destination in mind (for example, to walk your dog, to engage in physical recreation, or simply to get some fresh air) as long as you maintain physical distancing and comply with any other applicable public health directives.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	13
Are gatherings permitted?	Gatherings are defined as meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are now permitted indoors in counties in Substantial (red), Moderate (orange), and Minimal (yellow) tiers, subject to [certain restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/#worship) in those counties. State public health directives also permit in-person outdoor faith-based services or protests as long as face coverings are worn and physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times.\n\nCrowds and limited physical distancing increase the risk for COVID-19. If you attended a gathering, remember that confidential, free testing is available. [Find a testing location near you](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__covid19.ca.gov_testing-2Dand-2Dtreatment_-23top&d=DwMGaQ&c=Lr0a7ed3egkbwePCNW4ROg&r=yRsi0eKVK6Khc58oFC32XROAJ-JqVGBGabDv9P6148k&m=Iul4bdNDGFuRu3rXHrxPHNWT2PT2bXFITW3YP1tzG94&s=4qpOZ7lX1S5M_STTblq_XAQNu05ccIFwIyu4bvl9U3c&e=). If you test negative it does not mean that you may not develop COVID-19 later on. Therefore, it is advisable that you self-isolate for 14 days if possible.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	14

Are safety protocols being enforced? How do I report a business that isn’t complying?	They are being enforced, and you can report it. Report unsafe conditions or businesses that shouldn’t be open to your local Alcohol Beverage Control, Labor Commissioner’s office, or regional Cal/OSHA office, depending on the type of business. To find these local contacts, see Appendix B of the [Employer Playbook for a Safe Reopening (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/employer-playbook-for-safe-reopening--en.pdf).\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- Adding keywords mask masks report reporting enforce enforcement compliance for quick answers purposes -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	16
I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard without raising public health concerns?	There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.  \n\nAdditionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you comply with any other applicable public health directives. When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.\n\nIf collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.  The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car activities to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.  Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.  \n\nWhenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.\n\nIf you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	17
Can I engage in political protest gatherings?	Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _outdoor_ protests as long as you maintain a physical distance of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households at all times. When you can’t maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet from people not in your household, you must wear a face covering or mask. Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nIn counties in the [Widespread (purple) tier](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/), indoor protests are not currently permitted. In other counties, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _indoor_ protests as long as (1) attendance is limited as as required by the [relevant local restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) places of worship (2) physical distancing of 6 feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times, and (3) singing and chanting activities are discontinued. Failure to follow these requirements may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and face coverings are required in compliance with CDPH directives.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of 6 feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed regularly. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	18
How do I vote?	**[Elections are an essential activity](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/CDPH-to-SOS-Letter-from-Acting-HO-Aug-18-1.pdf).** The Governor has issued [executive orders to ensure elections are safe and accessible](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/). Vote-by-mail ballots will be sent to all registered voters for the November 3, 2020 General Election. Most counties will provide [three days of early voting](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/06/03/governor-newsom-signs-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-accessible-general-election-in-november/) in-person starting the Saturday before the election.

Places of worship such as churches, mosques, temples, and synagogues can open throughout the state, with [modifications for safety (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). In counties in the [Widespread (purple)](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) tier, indoor services in places of worship must be discontinued but outdoor and online services are permitted.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	20
Can I practice my religious faith?	Yes. Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)<!-- church, mosque, synagogue, temple, wedding, funeral, baptism -->	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	21
What conditions must be met to resume religious services and cultural ceremonies at places of worship?	Information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at [guidance for places of worship (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship--en.pdf). Additional conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity. It is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, singing and chanting activities must be discontinued at indoor services, and congregants engaging in group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship may only open indoor operations when permitted by [relevant local restrictions](https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy) and must comply with all applicable attendance limitations and guidance requirements.\n\nLocal Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on _outdoor_ attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. At a minimum, outdoor attendance should be limited naturally through implementation of strict physical distancing measures of a minimum of 6 feet between attendees from different households, in addition to other relevant protocols within this document.\n\nThis limitation will be regularly reviewed by the California Department of Public Health.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	22
Can children attend group activities (like Sunday school or Hebrew school) at places of worship?

Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block?	It’s okay to go outside to go for a walk, to exercise, and participate in healthy activities as long as you **maintain a safe physical distance of 6 feet and gather only with members of your household.** You can also participate in activities at [outdoor recreational facilities](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-campgrounds-outdoor-recreation--en.pdf) that are allowed to open. [Parks may be closed](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/) to help slow the spread of the virus. Young people can participate in sports as permitted by the [youth sports guidance (PDF)](https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-youth-sports--en.pdf). Check with local officials about park closures in your area. Californians should not travel significant distances for recreation and should stay close to home.\n\nBelow is a list of some outdoor recreational activities.\n\n*   Badminton (singles)\n*   Throwing a baseball/softball\n*   BMX biking\n*   Canoeing (singles)\n*   Crabbing\n*   Cycling\n*   Exploring rock pools\n*   Gardening (not in groups)\n*   Golfing (doubles, only if cart has protective partition)\n*   Hiking (trails/ paths allowing distancing)\n*   Horse riding (singles)\n*   Jogging and running\n*   Kite boarding and kitesurfing\n*   Meditation\n*   Outdoor photography\n*   Picnics (with your household members only)\n*   Quad biking\n*   Rock climbing\n*   Roller skating and rollerblading\n*   Rowing (singles)\n*   Scootering (not in groups)\n*   Skateboarding (not in groups)\n*   Soft martial arts – tai chi, chi kung (not in groups)\n*   Surfing\n*   Tennis and table tennis (singles)\n*   Throwing a football, kicking a soccer ball (not in groups)\n*   Trail running\n*   Trampolining\n*   Tree climbing\n*   Volleyball (singles)\n*   Walk the dog\n*   Wash the car\n*   Watch the sunrise or sunset\n*   Yoga\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/	 	[]	false	[]	25

Can I visit State Parks? What outdoor spaces are open?	State Parks, campgrounds, museums, and visitor centers [may continue to be closed](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=30350) to help slow the spread of the virus. Starting June 12, some counties may open campgrounds and RV parks. Be sure to check [parks in your area before you travel](https://covid19.ca.gov/public-recreation/). Californians should not travel significant distances for pleasure or recreation and should stay close to home. If you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.\n\nYou can walk, run, hike and bike in your local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice physical distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails and parking lots.\n\n\-->\n\n#### Can I travel?\n\nYou can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks.

Cohorts for children and youth in supervised settings – updated September 4	A **cohort** is a stable group of no more than 14 children or youth and no more than two supervising adults in a supervised environment. The group stays together for all activities, including meals and recreation. And this group avoids contact with anyone not in their group.\n\nKids and adults in supervised care environments must be in groups as small as possible. Kids and supervising adults in one group must not physically interact with:\n\n*   kids and supervising adults in other groups\n*   other facility staff\n*   parents of kids in other groups\n\nPracticing a cohort structure:\n\n*   decreases opportunities for exposure to or transmission of the virus\n*   facilitates more efficient contact tracing in the event of a positive case\n*   allows for targeted testing, quarantine, and isolation of a single group instead of an entire population of kids and supervising adults\n\nThe [guidance related to cohorts](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/small-groups-child-youth.aspx) of children and youth sets minimum guidelines for providing specialized, targeted support services, necessary in-person child supervision and limited instruction, and facilitation of distance learning in small group environments in ways that maintain the focus on health and safety to minimize transmission.

Should I wear a mask or face covering to protect against COVID-19?	Yes. Californians must wear face coverings when in public spaces, especially indoors and other areas where physical distancing is not possible. Face coverings help reduce the spread of COVID-19. \n\nThe California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has released [guidance for the use of face coverings](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Guidance-for-Face-Coverings_06-18-2020.pdf). \n\nThe guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be: \n\n*   Maintain six feet of physical distance from others \n*   Wash hands frequently\n*   Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands\n*   Avoid being around people with COVID-19 symptoms\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	213
What is a face covering?	A face covering, also known as a cloth mask, is [material that covers the nose and mouth](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html). It can be secured to the head with ties or straps or simply wrapped around the lower face. It can be made of a variety of materials, such as cotton, silk, or linen. A face covering may be factory-made or sewn by hand, or can be improvised from household items such as scarfs, T-shirts, sweatshirts, or towels.\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	214
How well do face coverings prevent spread of COVID-19?	There is scientific evidence to suggest that use of masks or face coverings reduces disease transmission. Their primary role is to reduce the release of infectious particles into the air when someone speaks, coughs, or sneezes. Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing, washing hands, and staying home when ill, but complements them.\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	215
How should I care for a cloth mask or face covering?	It’s a good idea to [wash your face covering](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html) frequently, ideally after each use. Have a bag or bin to keep face coverings in until they can be laundered with detergent and hot water and dried on a hot cycle. If you must re-wear your face covering before washing, wash your hands immediately after putting it back on and avoid touching your face. Discard face coverings that:\n\n*   No longer cover the nose and mouth\n*   Have stretched out or damaged ties or straps\n*   Cannot stay on the face\n*   Have holes or tears in the fabric\n\nSee advice from the CDC on [how to select, wear, and clean your mask](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).\n\nMore info: [Masks and face coverings](https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/masks-and-ppe/	 	[]	false	[]	216
Is blood plasma authorized as a COVID-19 treatment?	[The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-convalescent-plasma-potential-promising-covid-19-treatment) for convalescent plasma to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe FDA determined that it is reasonable to believe that COVID-19 convalescent plasma may be effective in making  COVID-19 illness shorter and less severe in some patients. The FDA also determined that the known and potential benefits of this plasma, when used to treat COVID-19, outweigh its known and potential risks. There are no adequate, approved, or available alternative treatments.\n\nMore info: [Survivors of COVID-19: Donate your plasma](https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/)	https://covid19.ca.gov/plasma/	 	[]	false	[]	217
