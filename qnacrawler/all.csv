Practicing your faith is a constitutionally-protected activity and may manifest in many different forms.\n\nAlthough in-person religious gatherings—like other in-person gatherings—have been restricted to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, on May 25, 2020, the State Public Health Officer  began to ease restrictions on in-person religious gatherings. In particular, the State Public Health Officer now authorizes County Departments of Public Health to allow collective activities at places of worship, subject to conditions to support a safe, clean environment for employees, interns and trainees, volunteers, scholars, and all other types of workers as well as congregants, worshippers, and visitors.","","","church, worship, religion, religious, faith, gathering","","Kayla","","","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/","","","","[]","FALSE","[]","96"
"What conditions must be met to resume religious services at places of worship?","Full information on conditions imposed by the state can be found at[ guidance for places of worship.](https://covid19.ca.gov/pdf/guidance-places-of-worship.pdf) Additionally conditions may be imposed by local public health officials. This guidance does not obligate places of worship to resume in-person activity and it is strongly recommended that places of worship continue to facilitate remote services and other alternatives to in-person religious practice for those who are vulnerable to COVID19.\n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, convening in a congregational setting of multiple different households to practice a personal faith carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19, and may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like singing and group recitation dramatically increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. For this reason, congregants engaging in singing, particularly in the choir, and group recitation should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nPlaces of worship must therefore limit attendance to 25% of building capacity or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower. This limitation will be in effect for the first 21-days of a county public health department’s approval of religious services and cultural ceremonies activities at places of worship within their jurisdictions.","","","church, worship, religion, religious, faith, gathering","","Kayla","","","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/","","","","[]","FALSE","[]","97"

"When will these conditions change for places of worship?","Every 21 days, the California Department of Public Health, in consultation with county Departments of Public Health, will review and assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of activities in places of worship. This is because COVID-19 has an incubation period of 14 days; the 21-day interval accounts for this incubation period and provides for an additional seven days for thorough review, analysis, and preparation of modifications.","When will the limits for places of worship be lifted?","","church, worship, religion, religious, faith, gathering","","Kayla","","","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/","","","","[]","FALSE","[]","99"
