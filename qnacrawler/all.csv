"Is it safe to shop at open businesses?","The risk of COVID-19 infection is still real for all Californians and continues to be fatal.

"Are mass gatherings permitted?","State public health directives prohibit professional, social and community mass gatherings. Gatherings are defined as—meetings or other events that bring together persons from multiple households at the same time for a shared or group experience in a single room, space, or place such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, or other indoor or outdoor space. They pose an especially high danger of transmission and spread of COVID-19.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, in an effort to balance First Amendment interests with public health, the State Public Health Officer created an exception to the prohibition against mass gatherings for faith-based services and cultural ceremonies as well as protests. Those types of gatherings are permitted so long as they do not exceed 100 attendees or 25% of the capacity of the space in which the gathering is held, whichever is lower. All other mass gatherings are prohibited until further notice.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/"," ","[]","false","[]","14"

"Can I visit my family and friends?","It is best to stay connected with your loved ones through phone and video calls, as visiting family and friends outside your household still presents a risk of spreading coronavirus. Keeping distance from others is especially important for people that are at higher risk of getting very sick, including older people, and people of any age who have underlying medical conditions. \n\nIf you do visit family or friends that don’t live in your home in person, take steps to keep everyone safe, like:\n\n*   Keep at least 6 feet between yourself and others, even when you wear a face covering\n*   Visit outdoors instead of indoors when possible\n*   Wear a face covering or cloth mask\n*   Wash your hands often\n*   Clean and disinfect commonly- touched surfaces\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/"," ","[]","false","[]","16"
"I want to express my political views.  How can I make my voice heard?","There are many ways for you to express your political views without holding a physical, in-person gathering.  For example, you may continue to call or write elected officials, write letters to the editor of news publications, display lawn or window signs, or use online and other electronic media (including Zoom rooms, Twitter feeds, Facebook pages, and other digital forums) to express your views.  \n\nAdditionally, as noted above, you may leave your home for any reason as long as you **do not gather with people who are not members of your household**.  When you are otherwise out in public, public health directives do not prevent you from engaging in political expression—such as by wearing or carrying a sign.\n\nIf collective action in physical space is important to you, consider whether you and other participants can safely protest from within your cars.  The State Public Health Officer does not consider in-car protests to be gatherings, if participants stay in their cars and otherwise remain apart from individuals who are not part of their households.  Many activists have organized car-based protests (honking horns, flying flags, displaying signs, and so on) to express their political views while complying with State public health directives.  \n\nWhenever you are considering a protest (including an in-car protest), make sure you comply with all other applicable laws, including any local public-health measures that may be more restrictive than statewide directives and any other applicable local laws.\n\nIf you do wish to engage in in-person protest outside of your car with a group of any size, you must follow the guidelines for political protest gatherings below.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/"," ","[]","false","[]","17"
"Can I engage in political protest gatherings?","Yes, although in-person protests present special public health concerns. \n\nEven with adherence to physical distancing, bringing members of different households together to engage in in-person protest carries a higher risk of widespread transmission of COVID-19.  Such gatherings may result in increased rates of infection, hospitalization, and death, especially among more vulnerable populations. In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through six feet of physical distancing. For this reason, people engaging in these activities should wear face coverings at all times.\n\nTherefore, it is strongly recommended that those exercising their right to engage in political expression (including, for example, their right to petition the government) should utilize alternative channels, such as the many online and broadcasting platforms available in the digital age, in place of in-person gatherings. \n\nHowever, state public health directives do not prohibit in-person _outdoor_ protests as long as physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Additionally, Local Health Officers are advised to consider appropriate limitations on outdoor attendance capacities, factoring their jurisdiction’s key COVID-19 health indicators. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and cloth face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nState public health directives do not prohibit in-person _indoor_ protests as long as (1) attendance is limited to 25% of the relevant area’s maximum occupancy, as defined by the relevant local permitting authority or other relevant authority, or a maximum of 100 attendees, whichever is lower, and (2) physical distancing of six feet between persons or groups of persons from different households is maintained at all times. Failure to maintain adequate physical distancing may result in an order to disperse or other enforcement action. Masks and cloth face coverings are strongly recommended.\n\nParticipants must maintain a physical distance of six feet from any uniformed peace officers and other public safety personnel present, unless otherwise directed, and follow all other requirements and directives imposed by local health officers and law enforcement, or other applicable authorities.\n\nThis limitation on attendance will be reviewed at least once every 21 days. This review will assess the impacts of these imposed limits on public health and provide further direction as part of a phased-in restoration of gatherings that implicate the First Amendment.\n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/"," ","[]","false","[]","18"

"Can I travel?","You can travel for urgent matters or if such travel is essential to your permitted work. Even though businesses around the state are opening up, avoid travelling long distances for vacations or pleasure as much as possible. This is to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Do not travel if you are sick, or if someone in your household has had coronavirus in the last two weeks. Do not travel with someone who is sick.\n\nBefore travelling away from your community, consider these questions from the [Center for Disease Control (CDC) travel guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-in-the-us.html):\n\n*   Is coronavirus spreading where you are traveling?\n*   Are you or those you are traveling with more likely to get very sick from coronavirus?\n*   Will you be able to keep 6 feet of physical distance from others during or after your trip?\n\nIf you do travel, take steps to keep everyone safe like wearing a face cloth covering, keeping 6 feet of physical distance from those not in your household, and washing your hands frequently.  \n\nMore info: [Stay home Q&A](https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/)","https://covid19.ca.gov/stay-home-except-for-essential-needs/"," ","[]","false","[]","28"
